# As of right now, I'm working on the code that ALyssa gave my to find an easier
# way to scrape data from websites. For this week, I manually added the runs per
# team per season as well as strikeouts as a pitching staff to excel files,
# which wasn't too difficult, but we're looking for an easier way to do
# attendance because that would be very difficult to do manually. Also, I'm
# trying to find a way to include team logos instead of dots.

I have five data sets loaded in and have added more graphs, so I now have 31
different graphs, one for runs, batting average, strikeouts per 9 innings as
pitchers and errors for the years 2010-2019 (strikeouts I only have 2019). My
next steps are to continue adding data, most importantly attendance, as well as
some others. I also want to begin exploring data that mightn ot exist explicitly
such as number of offseason transactions, which I would most likely have to just
manually count. I also want to add images in place of the points on the plots
and also see if there is a way to denote which team won the world series each
year. I have already added lines of best fit, and hope to use the linear
regressions to show something, too although I'm not quite sure what that is
going to be at this point.
